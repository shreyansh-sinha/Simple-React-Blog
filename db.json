      "content": "The best blogs share similar properties that make them successful: they post engaging and useful content that attracts visitors and makes them want to read more. Popular blog writers know how to communicate with their target audience, as they understand how their readership thinks and feels.\n\nTop-rated online blogs have plenty of traffic. Apart from enjoying well-deserved popularity, many blogs can become a lucrative source of income for talented bloggers.\n\nHowever, the quality of the content itself is sometimes not enough, meaning that most popular blogs also pay attention to design. Therefore, when creating this list, we also considered the best blog designs."
